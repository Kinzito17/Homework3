<center><h1>Password Generator</h1></center>

<p>I was tasked with writing the Javascript code for a random password generator. The method I used was to to concatenate all of the arrays that were prompted and confirmed in to a new array. I then created a for loop that randomly assigned a charachter for the number of characters the user selected.</p>

<p>I'm unsure why the link is only returning the readme page but the code is in the repository in the Develop folder.</p>
